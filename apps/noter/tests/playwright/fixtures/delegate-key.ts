/**
 * Delegate-key auth helpers.
 *
 * `connectDelegateKey` calls `assertDelegateAccountBinding`, which verifies
 * the derived public key is registered on the claimed account — on real
 * chain data outside tests, and against the shared fixture pool
 * (`package/feature/auth/lib/delegate-fixtures.ts`) when isTestEnvironment
 * is set (playwright.config.ts / test:e2e pass PLAYWRIGHT=True).
 *
 * Identities come from that single pool so the mock and this fixture cannot
 * drift. The allocator throws when the pool is exhausted rather than wrapping
 * back to fixture 0 (which would collide two tests on the same notes).
 *
 * A fixture key is NOT enough to write to Walrus Memory: isTestEnvironment
 * is true for every Playwright-started server, so the binding check only
 * ever consults the fixture pool. There's no live-write path in this suite
 * by design; see the note in e2e/memory.test.ts.
