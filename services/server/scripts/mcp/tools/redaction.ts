/**
 * Credential redaction for the memory write path (WALM-642).
 *
 * Every tool that forwards free text to the SDK — `memwal_remember`,
 * `memwal_remember_bulk`, `memwal_analyze` — runs its input through
 * `sanitizeFact` FIRST. The model-facing rules in `memory-policy.ts` are
 * guidance; this module is the backstop that does not depend on a model having
 * read them. Walrus storage is append-only and immutable: a secret that reaches
 * it cannot be deleted, so the check has to sit in front of the write rather
 * than behind it.
 *
 * Two shapes of answer:
 *
 *   - REDACT (the common case, and what the ticket asks for): a message that
 *     mixes a durable preference with a credential keeps the preference and
 *     loses only the credential span, replaced by `[redacted:<kind>]`. Dropping
 *     the whole fact would lose the thing the user actually wanted stored.
 *   - REFUSE: nothing safe is left, the user said not to save it, or the text
 *     is plainly pasted third-party material. The caller forwards nothing.
 *
 * ── False positives, deliberately ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * The patterns below are SHAPE-based, not entropy-based. That is a choice, and
 * it costs recall:
 *
 *   - There is no free-standing "long random-looking string" rule. MemWal's own
 *     durable facts are exactly that shape — Walrus blob ids (43-char
 *     base64url), Sui object and account ids (`0x` + 64 hex), git SHAs (40 hex),
 *     content digests. A generic high-entropy rule would redact the product's
 *     primary nouns. The one entropy rule that survived
 *     (`HIGH_ENTROPY_SECRET`) demands ≥64 characters AND mixed case AND a
 *     digit, which excludes every one of those (all-lowercase hex, or shorter),
 *     while still catching a raw base64 key blob.
 *   - `password:`-style assignments redact whatever follows the separator, so
 *     "password: ask Marta" loses "ask Marta". Over-redacting a sentence about
 *     a credential is cheap; under-redacting the credential is permanent.
 *   - Hex key material is caught by the LABEL next to it, never by its shape —
 *     see `HEX_RUN`. That is what lets MemWal's own 64-hex delegate private key
 *     be removed while a bare 40-hex commit SHA or a `0x`-prefixed Sui object id
 *     is left alone. The cost is that a hex secret pasted with no label at all
 *     still passes; the model-facing rules are what cover that.
 *   - Quoted-content detection only fires on unambiguous pastes (a fenced
 *     block, a multi-line `>` quotation, or a ≥200-char fully quoted passage).
 *     A short quoted sentence is left to the model-facing rules, because an
 *     agent legitimately quotes the user's own words back when saving a fact.
 *
 * Nothing here logs, echoes, or returns the matched secret. Callers get the
 * redacted text and the KINDS that were removed — never the values.

 *
 * Two bounds on this pattern, both load-bearing:
 *
 *   - The scheme repeat is CAPPED. Unbounded (`[A-Za-z0-9+.-]*`) it had to be

 *     single-threaded, so a long paste was a stall for every other caller, not
 *     just for itself. 30 characters is longer than any registered scheme.
 *   - The userinfo groups exclude `?`, `=` and `&`, not just `/` and

 *     `https://app.example.com:8443?owner=alice@corp.com` matched with

 *     the mangled fact was written to append-only storage, and the result told
 *     the agent a credential had been removed when there was none. A query

 *
 * ── What the gate has to let in ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The keyword may start the identifier, sit mid-identifier, or follow a
 * separator character, so the left gate is `\b` OR a lookbehind covering
 * letters, digits, `_` and `-`:
 *
 *   - `(?<=[a-z])` is what makes `delegatePrivateKey` match — MemWal's own
 *     worst secret, where `PrivateKey` sits mid-identifier and a plain `\b`
 *     never fires.
 *   - `_` is a WORD character, so `\b` does not fire between `_` and `P`
 *     either, and `_` is not `[a-z]`. That left the entire SCREAMING_SNAKE
 *     namespace open: `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=`,
 *     `DB_PASSWORD=`, `X_AUTH_TOKEN:`, `SESSION_SECRET=` and `my_api_key=`
 *     all passed through verbatim — the exact spelling a credential arrives in
 *     when someone pastes an env file or a shell export.
 *
 * And a closing quote may sit between the keyword and the separator, because
 * that is what a JSON object looks like: `{"username": "alice", "password":
 * "hunter2-prod-9xQ"}` matched nothing at all before. The quote is captured
 * with the separator and written back, so the shape of the line survives; only
 * the value is replaced.
 *
 * `access[_-]?keys?` is in the list for `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: `secret` is
 * there, but the separator does not follow it, and no alternative covered the

 * entry is dropped, the rest of the batch still lands). Then a second pass asks
 * a question the first one cannot: is there a credential label in the text
 * ADJACENT to this value, where adjacent means the entries either side of it as
 * well as its own?
 *
 * A value that is an entry all by itself is screened against the whole batch

 * Screening a PASSAGE (WALM-642).
 *
 * `NO_SAVE_DIRECTIVE`, `OFF_THE_RECORD` and `isPastedContent` are whole-string
 * predicates, written for one fact and correct there. `memwal_analyze` applies
 * them to a whole transcript, where "whole string" means something else
 * entirely: one "don't save this part" line in a forty-turn conversation
 * refused the entire passage — `refusal`, `text: ""`, all forty turns
 * discarded, and a note telling the agent not to retry it. The call carried no
 * `isError`, so the client saw a successful call that had saved nothing.
 *
 * The fix is the one `memwal_remember_bulk` already uses on entries: scope the
 * refusal to the span that earned it. A passage is split into segments, each is
 * screened on its own, the offending ones are dropped and named, and everything
 * else is extracted from.
 *
 * Two deliberate wrinkles:
 *
 *   - A no-save directive drops its NEIGHBOURS too, within its own paragraph.
 *     "My bank PIN is 4821" on one line and "don't save this" on the next is
 *     the ordinary way people write it, and dropping only the second line would
 *     save the first — a far worse outcome than losing a turn either side.
 *   - A fenced block WRAPPING THE WHOLE PASSAGE is unwrapped rather than
 *     refused, when it has no language tag and holds a transcript's worth of
 *     lines. That shape is what this tool documents as its canonical input, and
 *     refusing it discarded exactly the passages people most wanted analysed. A
 *     tagged fence (```json, ```sh) is code, a short one is a snippet, and a
 *     fence INSIDE the passage is still dropped as a paste — none of those
 *     change.
