 * memwal_remember — persist a durable fact to MemWal.
 *
 * Returns as soon as the blob is written end-to-end (embed → SEAL encrypt →
 * Walrus upload → on-chain) when that happens inside `REMEMBER_WAIT_MS`.
 * Otherwise it returns the job_id and says plainly that the fact is not saved
 * yet — see `remember-wait.ts` for why the old always-block behaviour cost
 * 30–75s per call.
 *
 * Call this PROACTIVELY whenever the user reveals a durable fact about
 * themselves or the project (preference, decision, constraint, correction,
 * identity, recurring workflow) — you do not need to be explicitly asked.
 * Skip one-off tasks, the current file or bug, and small talk.
 * For several facts at once, prefer `memwal_remember_bulk`.
