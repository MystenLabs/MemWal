 * Mirrors `memwal_remember`: returns once every job reaches a terminal state
 * if that happens inside `REMEMBER_WAIT_MS`, and otherwise hands back the
 * job_ids saying plainly that the facts are not saved yet.
 *
 * Blocking here was worse than blocking on a single fact, not better. The
 * server instructions steer an agent to this tool whenever it learned more
 * than one thing, so it is the common path — and a batch is N separate Walrus
 * writes contending for the same upload slots
 * (`WALRUS_UPLOAD_PER_WALLET_CONCURRENCY` defaults to 1), so they land one
 * after another rather than together. Against a 30–75s single-write spread a
 * five-fact batch could exhaust the old fixed 120s budget outright and return
 * nothing but timeouts, having blocked the agent for two minutes first.
