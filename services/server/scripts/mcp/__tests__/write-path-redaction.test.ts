/**
 * No credential reaches the SDK from any write tool (WALM-642).
 *
 * The ticket was reproduced exactly here: a preference plus a fake password URL
 * sent through the real MCP server, with the SDK mocked, and `remember`,
 * `remember_bulk` and `analyze` all passed the full text through unchanged.
 * These tests are that repro, inverted — the mock now records everything the
 * handler forwards, and every assertion is about what the SDK was *given*, not
 * about what the tool said afterwards. A handler that redacted its reply but
 * still forwarded the secret would pass a message-only test and fail these.
 *
 * Walrus storage is append-only and immutable, which is why the check has to be
 * in front of the write: there is no delete to fall back on.
 *
 * The wait budget is zeroed so each tool returns at accept. That is the shortest
 * path through each handler and it exercises the same pre-forward screen; the
 * bounded-wait branch is covered by the `*-fast-return` files.
