/// GET /api/accounts/{owner}/exists
///
/// Public, unauthenticated by design: the underlying `AccountRegistry` is
/// itself a public onchain Sui object, so anyone can already determine
/// whether an address owns a MemWalAccount via a direct RPC scan (see
/// docs/indexer/purpose.md's "onchain registry scan" fallback). This
/// endpoint is a convenience/performance wrapper around the indexer's
/// already-public data (populated from onchain `AccountCreated` events),
/// not a new information disclosure — so it deliberately does not require
/// Console-specific auth. Do not add auth here without re-checking that
/// reasoning first.
///
/// Response is intentionally minimal (`{ "exists": bool }`): the internal
/// `account_id` is not returned, since Console doesn't need it per
/// WALM-298's acceptance criteria and leaking it would needlessly widen
/// the API's surface for future churn.
///
/// This checks registry presence only, not onchain `active` status — an
/// address that once created a MemWalAccount and was later deactivated
/// still resolves to `exists: true`. The primary reason is mechanical, not
/// by-design elsewhere: `services/indexer/src/handler.rs`'s `AccountPipeline`
/// only decodes the `AccountCreated` event type — there is no deactivation
/// event handler in the indexer at all — so a row inserted into the
/// off-chain `accounts` table this endpoint queries is never removed or
/// updated afterwards, regardless of what happens to the account onchain.
/// That happens to line up with the onchain `AccountRegistry` design
/// described in docs/architecture/permanent-registry-design.md (a
/// deactivated account is intentionally kept permanently in the registry
/// too), which is supporting context for why this is an acceptable
/// property to leave as-is rather than an oversight to fix — but it is not
/// itself why the off-chain table behaves this way. Live active/usable
/// status gating belongs to WALM-297's token issuance, not this existence
/// check.
