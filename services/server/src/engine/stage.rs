//! Which step of a recall is running, so one that runs out of time can say
//! where it was stuck.
//!
//! The handler owns a [`StageMarker`] and runs the recall inside
//! [`run_with_deadline`], which makes that marker the task's current one.
//! Anything the recall awaits on the same task — the engine's `fetch_batch`
//! included — calls [`enter`] as it moves on, so the trait needs no extra
//! parameter. Outside a recall (`analyze` shares `fetch_batch`) `enter` does
//! nothing.
