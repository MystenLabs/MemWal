//! Extractor service — turns raw text into a list of memorable facts via an LLM.
//!
//! The default production impl (`LlmExtractor`) calls an OpenAI-compatible
//! `/chat/completions` endpoint (`openai/gpt-4o-mini`, temperature 0.1)
//! with a fixed system prompt, then parses the response one-fact-per-line
//! (the explicit "NONE" reply normalises to an empty list) and truncates
//! to [`MAX_ANALYZE_FACTS`].
//!
//! Lifted verbatim from `routes.rs::extract_facts_llm` + `parse_extracted_facts`.
//! The system prompt is a versioned text asset
//! (`services/prompts/extract.txt`, bundled at compile time via
//! `include_str!`) so it can change without a Rust edit and its version
//! ([`FACT_EXTRACTION_PROMPT_VERSION`]) can be recorded in benchmark run
//! artifacts.

///
/// `extract.v2`: relaxed the "facts about the user" scope to

///
/// `extract.v3`: adds a per-fact importance bucket (vital /

/// `scoring_weights.importance` is non-zero; default weights ignore it.
///
/// `extract.v4`: adds the `<related_memories>` pre-extraction
/// dedup context. The prompt instructs the LLM to:
/// (a) skip facts already present in `<related_memories>`, (b) anchor
/// borderline content by emitting only the new pieces relative to

/// already-known" — letting borderline assistant content be confidently

///
/// v5: adds a granularity carve-out to the `<related_memories>`
/// dedup rules. v4's broad "don't re-extract a paraphrase" instruction
/// over-suppressed atomic facts (list items, titles, numbers) when a
/// SUMMARY of the same topic was in the context block — dropping
/// LME `single_session_assistant` to 57.6. v5 explicitly tells the

/// exists, and adds a worked summary-vs-atomic example. Preserves v4's
/// exact-paraphrase dedup (the mechanism behind the LOCOMO win).
/// Source: `prompts/extract.txt`.
///
/// v6: adds a `<context occurred_at="..."/>` temporal anchor.
/// When the caller supplies an absolute RFC-3339 timestamp via
/// `AnalyzeRequest.occurred_at`, the extractor uses it to:
/// (a) attach a verbose absolute date (`Weekday, D Month YYYY
/// (YYYY-MM-DD)`) to facts describing current/recent events, (b)
/// resolve specific relative references ("last Friday", "yesterday")
/// to absolute dates, (c) keep vague references honest ("a few years
/// ago" → keep as-is; "next week" → anchor to a month when possible),
/// and (d) preserve original dates on recounted past events. Defensive
/// default: when uncertain whether a fact is time-anchored, the LLM
/// is instructed to prefer leaving the date off (a missing date is
/// recoverable; a wrongly-stamped date pollutes retrieval).
