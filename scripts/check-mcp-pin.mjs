/**
 * The version the plugin launcher installs must exist on npm.
 *
 * `pinnedVersion()` in packages/mcp/plugin/scripts/lib/mcp-launch.mjs reads
 * `mcpPackageVersion` out of plugin.json and installs exactly that. npm has no
 * such version, the install fails, and the launch fails with it — every fresh
 * plugin install, on every editor, until someone edits the manifest. That is not
 * hypothetical: on 2026-09-17 the launchers pinned `@0.0.14` while npm carried
 * only 0.0.13 and 0.0.14-dev.0, because plugin.json had been bumped for a release
 * that had not shipped.
 *
 * A unit test cannot catch this — whether a version exists is a fact about npm,
 * not about the repository — so it lives here.
 *
 * Two findings, deliberately unequal:
 *
 *   ERROR   the pin is not published. The launcher cannot install it. Blocking.
 *           One exception: on a ref headed for `main`, a pin equal to
 *           packages/mcp/package.json's version is the release being cut, and
 *           release-mcp.yml publishes exactly that from this tree moments later.
 *           Erroring there would redden every release. The exception is scoped to
 *           `main` on purpose: `dev` pinning an unpublished release version is
 *           precisely the 2026-09-17 bug, and must stay an error.
 *
 *   WARNING the pin is published but is not what the dist-tag for this branch
 *           points at. Not blocking, because it cannot be: pushing to `dev`
 *           publishes a NEW `dev.N` and never commits that number back, so the
 *           manifest is one behind by construction for most of its life. Failing
 *           on that would redden CI after every merge. It is still worth saying —
 *           0.0.14-dev.0 outlived the relayer change that made its own
 *           instructions wrong, and nothing anywhere said so.
