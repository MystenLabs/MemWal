/**
 * "Auth-required" stdio MCP server — run when ~/.memwal/credentials.json is
 * missing but the package was spawned by an MCP client (Cursor / Claude
 * Desktop / etc.).
 *
 * Instead of exiting (which makes the MCP client show a cryptic
 * "Failed to start server" error that the user can't act on), we boot a
 * minimal MCP server that:
 *
 *   - Responds to `initialize` so the client sees a healthy server.
 *   - Advertises the 4 real Walrus Memory tools + a 5th `memwal_login` tool in
 *     `tools/list` so the agent knows what's available.
 *   - On `tools/call memwal_login`: invokes the browser-based wallet login
 *     flow inline so the user never has to leave their MCP client. Eliminates
 *     the previous "run a separate `npx ... login` command then restart" UX.
 *   - On any other `tools/call`: returns `isError: true` with a friendly
 *     instruction telling the agent to call `memwal_login` first (or run
 *     the CLI command as a fallback).
 *
 * Note: HTTP transport (`/api/mcp`) gets a separate native OAuth flow per
 * MCP spec 2025-06 — see ENG-1750. The two paths cover different surfaces
 * and coexist.

/**
 * Run the auth-required stdio MCP server.
 *
 * Resolves with an {@link AuthHandoff} the moment `memwal_login` completes and
 * the next memory tool call (or tools/list) arrives — so the caller can pick up
 * the real bridge IN THE SAME PROCESS, eliminating the second client restart.
 * Resolves with `undefined` if stdin closes before any sign-in.
 *
 * We manage the stdin listeners directly (rather than via the shared
 * `readStdinLines`) so we can DETACH cleanly at handoff: the bridge attaches its
 * own reader next, and two concurrent `data` listeners would double-process
 * every line. `pause()` keeps any bytes that arrive during the switch buffered
 * until the bridge's reader resumes the stream.
 *
 * The `config` parameter carries the same `relayerUrl` / `webUrl` / `label`
 * that the rest of the CLI resolved (e.g. `--dev` → dev URLs). Without it,
 * `memwal_login` would fall back to prod defaults and open the wrong dashboard.
