/**
 * MCP `instructions` payloads for the two local initialize responders.
 *
 * Clients inject this field into the model's system prompt during the
 * `initialize` handshake, before any `tools/list`. That makes it the only
 * proactive-usage channel that survives lazy tool loading, which is what broke
 * proactive save/recall in the first place (WALM-324): the guidance used to
 * live only in tool descriptions, and clients stopped putting those in context
 * until a tool was explicitly loaded.
 *
 * Both local responders need their own copy because the bridge answers
 * `initialize` itself and SUPPRESSES the relayer's reply (see
 * `buildLocalInitializeResult` in bridge.ts). Without this, the relayer's
 * instructions are correct but unreachable for every stdio client.
 *
 * The relayer keeps a separate copy in
 * services/server/scripts/mcp/server.ts, which serves the direct HTTP/OAuth
 * connector path. It cannot share this module: that file belongs to the
 * standalone `memwal-server-scripts` npm package with no workspace link here.
 * Keep the two in sync, except: this copy must not name a tool cold start
 * does not advertise (`memwal_remember_status` is the worked example — GH
 * #928). The sidecar copy may name it; that process actually registers the
 * tool.
 *
 * The secret-exclusion paragraph is not retyped in either, it comes from the
 * shared policy block (memory-policy.ts here, tools/memory-policy.ts there),
 * which is pinned byte-for-byte by tests on both sides.
 *
 * WALM-642 split the REMEMBER section in two. Whether the model is told to
 * save unprompted now depends on the user having turned automatic memory on;
 * saving what the user explicitly asks for is unconditional, and is what the
 * opted-out text still describes.
