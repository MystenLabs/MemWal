/**
 * Automatic-save consent (WALM-642).
 *
 * Saving a fact the user explicitly asked for has never needed permission and
 * still does not. What this module governs is the other thing the package does:
 * saving what it judges durable, without being asked. That is what MemWal is
 * for — so it is ON — but a person has to have been told what it means first.
 *
 * ── Three states, not two ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `off` and `on` are answers. `unset` is the absence of one, and it is not the
 * same as `off`:
 *
 *   - **Answered** (`autoSave: true|false` in settings.json) — from the login
 *     prompt or from `memwal-mcp auto-save on|off`. Nothing re-asks.
 *   - **Unset on an install that predates this change** — no settings file at
 *     all, but credentials on disk. These users have been auto-saving all
 *     along; switching them off would be a regression dressed up as caution, so
 *     saving CONTINUES and the question is put to them at their next
 *     interactive login.
 *   - **Unset on a new install** (`autoSaveConsent: "pending"`, stamped the
 *     moment a post-change install first appears) — nobody has been asked, so
 *     nothing is saved unprompted until someone answers. Explicit tool calls
 *     and recall keep working the whole time.
 *
 * The stamp is what separates the last two. Without it a headless install could
 * sign in through the `memwal_login` tool, look indistinguishable from a
 * long-standing user, and start saving on its own — consent by never having
 * been asked.
 *
 * ── Where the answer lives: the trusted state dir, and nowhere else ─────────
 * The answer is a decision about the HUMAN, not about a credentials directory.
 * It used to be stored beside whichever `credentials.json` won resolution,
 * which had two consequences, both wrong:
 *
 *   1. Approving a project's credentials (WALM-639) moved `settingsPath()`
 *      into the repository. A user who had already answered "off" globally got
 *      a directory with no answer in it, fell through to the legacy
 *      "credentials exist, so keep saving" rule, and had automatic memory
 *      switched back ON by an approval that was only ever about where writes
 *      go. The recorded "no" was never consulted there.
 *   2. `setAutoSave` / `markConsentPending` then wrote the consent answer INTO
 *      the repository, where it could be committed and shipped to everyone
 *      else who cloned it.
 *
 * So consent now lives in the trusted state dir — `MEMWAL_CREDS_DIR` when it is
 * set, else `~/.memwal` — the same directory auth.ts keeps the project-approval
 * store in, and for the same reason: a record a repository can write is a
 * repository approving itself. Project scoping of CREDENTIALS is unchanged;
 * project scoping of CONSENT is gone.
 *
 * The legacy probe reads the trusted directory's own `credentials.json` for the
 * same reason. "Has this person used MemWal before" must not be answerable by a
 * file inside a checkout.
 *
 * ── How the hooks see it ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The plugin's hooks are separate processes: a hook is spawned by the client,
 * not by this package, and inherits none of the MCP server's `env` or argv. The
 * hooks used to re-derive the whole resolution in plain ESM, and the two
 * implementations drifted — the hook side kept the pre-WALM-639 presence rule,
 * so a committed `.memwal/credentials.json` (contents never parsed, only
 * `existsSync`) turned automatic memory on for anyone who opened the repo.
 *
 * Re-deriving is the bug, so the hooks no longer do it. This module publishes
 * the RESOLVED state to `auto-save-state.json` in the trusted state dir, and
 * the hooks read only that. A repository cannot write there, the hooks do no
 * resolution of their own, and a hook that cannot read the file fails safe
 * (automatic memory off). See `plugin/scripts/lib/auto-save.mjs`.
