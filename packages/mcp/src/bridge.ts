/**
 * stdio ↔ remote-SSE bridge.
 *
 * The MCP client (Cursor, Claude Desktop, etc.) speaks **stdio** MCP — JSON
 * lines on stdin, JSON lines on stdout. The Walrus Memory relayer speaks **remote
 * SSE** MCP at `/api/mcp/sse` + `/api/mcp/messages`. This module glues the
 * two together so the user only adds a `command + args` entry to their MCP
 * client config (no headers, no URL).
 *
 * On 401 from the relayer, we surface a clear error to the MCP client but
 * leave the local credentials file untouched. A naive `clearCreds()` here
 * was a creds-wipe DoS: anyone able to coerce a 401 response (transient WAF
 * rule, future http_proxy MITM, local malware racing the relayer port on
 * `--local`) would have wiped the user's saved seed without consent.
 * Re-auth requires an explicit `memwal-mcp login` from the user.

     * behind an in-progress flush, on a perfectly healthy session.
