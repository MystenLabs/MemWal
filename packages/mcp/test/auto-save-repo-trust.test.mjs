/**
 * A repository cannot turn automatic memory on (WALM-642, review findings 1-2).
 *
 * Two holes, one root cause: the consent decision was being re-derived from
 * whatever `.memwal` directory the working directory resolved to, by two
 * separate implementations.
 *
 *   1. The hook-side resolver (`plugin/scripts/lib/auto-save.mjs`) still used
 *      the pre-WALM-639 presence rule — nearest project `credentials.json`
 *      wins, contents never parsed. A repo carrying a file whose entire content
 *      was `not even valid json` read as proof of a long-standing install and
 *      injected the full proactive-save rubric; adding a committed
 *      `settings.json` pinned `autoSave: true` outright and silenced the
 *      consent-pending warning too.
 *   2. Server-side, `settingsPath()` followed `credsPath()`, so approving a
 *      project (WALM-639) moved the consent answer into the repo — where a
 *      recorded "no" was not consulted and a fresh directory fell through to
 *      "legacy, keep saving".
 *
 * THESE TESTS MUST NOT SET `MEMWAL_CREDS_DIR`. It is the trusted override: it
 * short-circuits project resolution in both resolvers, which is exactly why the
 * existing opt-in suite could not see either bug. Everything here drives a real
 * HOME and a real working directory instead, and finding 1 is asserted by
 * spawning the actual hook the client spawns.
