/**
 * One sign-in prompt, whichever mode the user is in.
 *
 * `memwal_login` is answered locally in two places — the auth-required stub
 * when signed out, and the bridge when already signed in — and the two copies
 * had drifted: different assistant instructions, different step wording,
 * different closing line. Same tool, same user, two voices.
 *
 * They differ legitimately in exactly one respect: signing in while already
 * signed in REPLACES the stored delegate key, and that is worth saying. This
 * pins everything else as shared, so the next edit to one cannot silently
 * fork the other again.
