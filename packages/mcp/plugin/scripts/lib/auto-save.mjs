/**
 * Automatic-save opt-in, hook-side (WALM-642).
 *
 * This file used to be a hand-written MIRROR of `packages/mcp/src/auto-save.ts`
 * — the same walk up the directory tree, the same "nearest project-local
 * `.memwal/credentials.json` wins", the same settings lookup beside whatever
 * that resolved to. Keeping two implementations of one security decision in
 * step is not a thing anyone manages to do, and they drifted: the TypeScript
 * side grew an approval gate (WALM-639) and this side did not, so a repository
 * containing nothing but `.memwal/credentials.json` — contents never parsed,
 * only `existsSync` — read as proof of a long-standing install and switched
 * automatic memory ON for anyone who opened it. A committed `settings.json`
 * next to it could pin `autoSave: true` outright and silence the
 * consent-pending warning while it did.
 *
 * So the mirror is gone. The MCP server resolves the state — approvals,
 * project scoping, the consent answer, all of it — and publishes the ANSWER to
 * `auto-save-state.json` in the trusted state dir (`MEMWAL_CREDS_DIR`, else
 * `~/.memwal`). This file reads that file and nothing else.
 *
 * What that buys:
 *   - No resolution here at all, so there is nothing left to drift.
 *   - Nothing under `process.cwd()` is ever read, so a checkout cannot
 *     influence hook behaviour — not through a credentials file, not through a
 *     settings file, not through anything it can add later.
 *   - Unreadable, missing, malformed, or written by a newer version reads as
 *     "state unknown", which is automatic memory OFF. A hook must never block a
 *     session, and an absent answer is not consent.
 *
 * `MEMWAL_AUTO_SAVE` is still honoured first. It comes from this process's
 * environment — the client's hook configuration, set by the user — never from a
 * file a repository can carry.
