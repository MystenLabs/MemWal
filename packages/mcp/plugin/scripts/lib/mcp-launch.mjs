/**
 * Trusted-path resolution for the MemWal MCP server (WALM-640).
 *
 * The plugin used to start the server with `npx -y @mysten-incubation/memwal-mcp@<pin>`.
 * npx resolves a package name against the *current working directory* first, and an
 * MCP client starts its servers in the project the user has open. A project that
 * carries an installed package of the same name whose `version` matches the pin
 * therefore wins: the pinned `npx` command ran the project's own binary, offline,
 * with the user's credentials in reach. The version pin does not help, because the
 * fake package simply claims the pinned version.
 *
 * The fix is to stop resolving a *name* in an untrusted directory and to run an
 * *absolute path* inside a directory we own:
 *
 *   ~/.memwal/runtime/memwal-mcp@<version>/node_modules/@mysten-incubation/memwal-mcp
 *
 * What "a directory we own" means is enforced, not assumed. The runtime root — the
 * default one just as much as a `MEMWAL_MCP_RUNTIME_DIR` override — must be an
 * absolute path outside the project tree the client started in, must be a real
 * directory (`lstat`, so a symlink is refused), must belong to the current uid, and
 * must not be group- or world-writable. We create it with mode 0700. An absolute
 * path is *not* by itself a trusted path: `${workspaceFolder}/.memwal-runtime` is
 * absolute too, and a repository can commit a whole tree there.
 *
 * The pinned version is installed there once with npm, and every later launch is a
 * plain `node <absolute entry point>`. Nothing here ever looks at `process.cwd()`,
 * at a project `node_modules`, or at a bin shim found through PATH.
 *
 * Limits of the install step, stated plainly because a previous version of this
 * header overstated them:
 *
 *   - The install runs with `--ignore-scripts` and an explicitly pinned registry,
 *     and the `npm_config_*` / `NODE_OPTIONS` environment is scrubbed for that one
 *     spawn, so a repository-supplied client env block cannot redirect it. npm is
 *     invoked as `node <npm-cli.js>` resolved from `process.execPath` where that
 *     layout exists; only if it does not do we fall back to scanning PATH entries
 *     ourselves, skipping relative entries and entries inside the project tree.
 *   - Verification of the installed tree is a manifest check (name, pinned version,
 *     a `bin` that resolves back inside the package directory) plus the ownership
 *     and permission checks above. It is not a signature or integrity check of the
 *     package contents: it establishes *where* the code came from and that nobody
 *     else can write it, not that the registry served what a reviewer read.
 *
 * The version pin lives in exactly one place — `plugin/plugin.json`'s `version`,
 * which the release verifier already keeps equal to `packages/mcp/package.json` —
 * so the manifests cannot drift from the version that actually gets installed.
