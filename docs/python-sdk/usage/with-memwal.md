answer: >-
  The `with_memwal_langchain` and `with_memwal_openai` wrappers add automatic memory
  to existing LLM clients. Before each call, relevant memories are recalled and injected
  as a system message. After each call, the user message is analyzed for new facts and
  stored asynchronously. Both support options like max_memories, min_relevance, and auto_save.
---

`with_memwal_langchain` and `with_memwal_openai` wrap an existing LLM client with automatic memory management. Before each call relevant memories are recalled and injected; after each call the user message is analyzed for new facts (fire-and-forget).

Both integrations import their dependency lazily — install only what you use:

<CodeGroup>

```bash LangChain
pip install memwal[langchain]
```

```bash OpenAI
pip install memwal[openai]
```

</CodeGroup>

## LangChain

```python
import os
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage
from memwal import with_memwal_langchain

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
smart_llm = with_memwal_langchain(
    llm,
    key=os.environ["MEMWAL_PRIVATE_KEY"],
    account_id=os.environ["MEMWAL_ACCOUNT_ID"],
    env="prod",
    namespace="chatbot-prod",
    max_memories=5,
    min_relevance=0.3,
)

response = await smart_llm.ainvoke([HumanMessage("What are my food allergies?")])
```

Patches both `_agenerate` (async) and `_generate` (sync) on the model instance.

## OpenAI SDK

Works with both `openai.OpenAI` (sync) and `openai.AsyncOpenAI` (async) — the wrapper detects which and patches `chat.completions.create` accordingly.

```python
import os
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
from memwal import with_memwal_openai

client = AsyncOpenAI()
smart_client = with_memwal_openai(
    client,
    key=os.environ["MEMWAL_PRIVATE_KEY"],
    account_id=os.environ["MEMWAL_ACCOUNT_ID"],
    env="prod",
)

response = await smart_client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What are my food allergies?"}],
)
```

> The JS-style alias `withMemWal` is exported as a shortcut for `with_memwal_langchain`.

## What It Does

**Before generation:**

- Reads the last user message
- Runs `recall()` against Walrus Memory
- Filters by `min_relevance` (default `0.3`)
- Injects matching memories as a system message before the last user message

**After generation:**

- If `auto_save` (default `True`), saves the user message fire-and-forget using `save_mode`
- With the default `save_mode="analyze"`, `analyze()` extracts spoken-fact-style statements and stores one memory per fact, asynchronously
- With `save_mode="remember"`, the message is stored verbatim as a single memory

### Choosing a save mode

`analyze()` is lossy by design: it only extracts facts it can read as spoken statements. Code snippets, JSON, logs, and other non-sentence content produce zero facts, so nothing is stored. That path used to be silent; it now logs a warning naming the fix. When you are saving content like that, ask for verbatim storage:

```python
smart_client = with_memwal_openai(
    client,
    key=os.environ["MEMWAL_PRIVATE_KEY"],
    account_id=os.environ["MEMWAL_ACCOUNT_ID"],
    env="prod",
    save_mode="remember",  # store the message as-is, no fact extraction
)
```

## Confirming a Save

Auto-save is fire-and-forget, so the LLM response returns before the memory is durable. The wrapper exposes controls to close that gap:

| Control | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `await client.memwal_flush()` | Wait for in-flight auto-saves to be submitted |
| `client.memwal_flush_sync()` | Same, from sync code |
| `await client.memwal_wait_for_saves(opts)` | Flush, then poll every enqueued remember job to a terminal state |
| `client.memwal_wait_for_saves_sync(opts)` | Same, from sync code |
| `client.memwal` | The underlying `MemWal` client, for anything lower-level |

```python
response = await smart_client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "def f(): return 1"}],
)

result = await smart_client.memwal_wait_for_saves()
print(result.succeeded, result.failed, result.timed_out)
for item in result.results:
    print(item.status, item.blob_id)
```

`memwal_wait_for_saves()` returns a `RememberBulkResult`, so you get per-job status and blob IDs. Job IDs are drained once waited on: a second call only covers saves made since the first. Pass a `RememberBulkOptions` to tune `poll_interval_ms` and `timeout_ms`. Short-lived scripts should call one of these before exiting, or pending saves are lost when the process ends.

## Options

Both wrappers accept the same keyword arguments:

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `server_url` | `http://localhost:8000` | Explicit relayer URL (wins over `env`) |
| `env` | — | Hosted relayer preset: `staging` for testing or `prod` for production |
| `namespace` | `"default"` | Memory namespace |
| `max_memories` | `5` | Max memories injected per request |
| `auto_save` | `True` | Auto-save new facts from the conversation |
| `save_mode` | `"analyze"` | How auto-save persists the message: `"analyze"` (extract facts) or `"remember"` (store verbatim) |
| `min_relevance` | `0.3` | Minimum similarity (0–1) to include a memory |
| `debug` | `False` | Verbose logging via the `memwal` logger |

## When To Use Direct SDK Calls Instead

Use direct `MemWal` methods when you need precise control over when memory is stored, which text is analyzed, or how recall results are filtered and displayed.
